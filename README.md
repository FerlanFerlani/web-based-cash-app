## Getting Started
CashApp is a simple web-based monthly cash application, and in it there are two multi-level access rights, namely the admin level and the first user level, the Admin level as this Admin is the administrator or manager of incoming and outgoing funds and can also manage various kinds of data in it. , and the User level he can also make announcements, see details of the latest/updated funds in and out developments.

Not only that, this application is also equipped with a discussion feature where an Admin or User (All Registered) can communicate/chat directly with each other.

## How To Use
before you start using this application, of course, you must register first so you can enter to manage/view the data in it. First, the admin will record the bill of funds from each person per month and the data recorded is the name of the person who paid the cash and the nominal amount paid, by entering the "Cash bill" menu, select the current month's bill, then just enter the data. or fill in the form with the name of the cash payer and along with the nominal. besides that, the admin must also always update the progress of incoming and outgoing funds along with clear information. Admin can record it through the menu "manage incoming funds" and "manage outgoing funds" you just need to adjust the data you want to update whether it's incoming or outgoing funds, just fill in the form with clear information and if it's already click save. because this application does not have a data backup facility, every year the cash billing data from January to December for a certain year must be immediately deleted/updated to continue billing in the following year and month. For users, as described above, users can only see the progress of incoming and outgoing funds, discuss and make announcements.
